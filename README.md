Hi, I'm Cybersec-angus - An independant security researcher based in the UK. 

Although I currently don't have many repos, my priorities are primarily surrounding OSINT, public attack surfaces, and general NetSec.

My main project, Subd.py is a python tool that can enumerate subdomains, scan for services running behind a CNAME, and identify subdomains that are potential to hijack.
